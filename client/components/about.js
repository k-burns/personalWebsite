            I am a software engineer with a background in Psychology and
            education. I have always loved learning about how things work,
            including the structures of the brain. Psychology helped teach me to
            be patient and to remember that everyone has their own story. I used
            this knowledge to help me as the lead teacher at a childcare and
            later as a live-in nanny.

            I have been interested in coding since high school when I took a
            college level computers course and created a basic website. I was
            excited to get to create and learn basic coding, but being from a
            small town I didn't have the opportunity at the time to pursue more
            software engineering knowledge. I later moved to NYC and became a
            nanny. After moving to NYC I began to make friends who worked in
            different branches of the coding industry. I started to learn coding
            again and to create simple apps with them in my free time. The
            family I was nannying for moved and it felt like the perfect time
            for a new start to pursue software engineering. I attended the Grace
            Hopper program and Fullstack Academy. Since then I have been working
            on personal projects, studying algorithms, and looking for a team to
            continue the next step of my software engineering journey with.{' '}
