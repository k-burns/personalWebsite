      <p className="background">
        I am a software engineer with a background in Psychology and education.
        I have always loved learning about how things work, including the
        structures of the brain. Psychology helped teach me to be patient and to
        remember that everyone has their own story. I used this knowledge to
        help me as a teacher at a childcare and later as a live in nanny. I have
        been interested in coding since high school when I took a college level
        computers course and created a basic website. I was excited to get to
        create and learn basic coidng, but being from a small town I didn't have
        the oppertunity at the time to persue more software engineering
        knowledge. I later moved to NYC and became a nanny. After moving to NYC
        I began to make friends who worked in different branches of the coding
        industry. I started to learn coding again and to create simple apps with
        them in my free time. The family I was nannying for moved and it felt
        like the perfect time for a new start to pursue software engineering. I
        attended the Grace Hopper program and Fullstack Academy. Since then I
        have been working on personal projects, studying algorythims, and
        looking for a team to continue the next step of my software engineering
        journey with.
