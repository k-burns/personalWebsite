      I am a software engineer with a background in Psychology and education. I
      have always loved learning about how things work, including the structures
      of the brain. Psychology helped teach me to be patient and to remember
      that everyone has their own story. I used this knowledge to help me as a
      teacher at a childcare and later a live in nanny. I have been interested
      in coding for a long time. In high school I even made a very basic
      website. The family I was nannying for moved and it felt like the perfect
      time for a new start and to pursue software engineering. I love coding
      because it combines creativity and logical thinking.
